# Web UI flow audit

This is the active browser test plan for the Guildhall project surface. Keep it
updated while auditing `t-minus-t` so another agent can resume without guessing.

## Test workspace

- Guildhall repo: `/Users/matthew/git/oss/guildhall`
- Test project: `/Users/matthew/git/oss/t-minus-t`
- Serve command: `cd /Users/matthew/git/oss/t-minus-t && pnpm exec guildhall serve --port 4177`
- Browser target: `http://localhost:4177/`
- Expected project shape: a VSCode extension that lets users write TypeScript
  syntax in `.js` files and view/save it as JSDoc-backed JavaScript, with a
  converter package plus an extension package.

## Current Principle

Thread is the command surface. If the UI asks the user to understand hidden
state, jump across pages for a simple answer, or wait on a vague "agent is
working" card, fix the flow. The user should be able to answer questions,
correct the agent, and ask for direct action from Thread.

## Pass Checklist

1. Setup
   - Walk first-run setup in the browser.
   - At each step, ask what a new user would know, what they would not know,
     and whether the next action is obvious.
   - Verify provider detection, restart banners, and meta-intake status reflect
     real state.

2. Project spec
   - Run or resume meta-intake.
   - Verify it detects `t-minus-t` as a VSCode extension for converting
     on-disk JSDoc JavaScript into in-view TypeScript and back.
   - Confirm coordinators, bootstrap, levers, and project brief match the repo.

3. Workspace import
   - Review detected goals and tasks.
   - Verify imported README bullets do not duplicate title/rationale.
   - Verify imported TODO comments do not become worker-ready tasks without
     spec-agent shaping.

4. Task setup
   - Use Thread to guide Guildhall toward tasks covering TypeScript features.
   - Try direct Thread replies/tool-like commands when the provided card does
     not fit the need.
   - Verify user answers immediately change visible project/task state.

5. Execution and completion
   - Push at least one task through intake, spec review, ready, worker,
     review, gates, and done when feasible.
   - At each transition, verify Thread, drawer, Work, and Notifications agree.
   - Check that "done" means a concrete repo change plus passing verification,
     not just an agent claim.

6. Reset rule
   - If the test project state becomes too tangled to reason about, stop and
     request action-time confirmation before deleting Guildhall state files.
   - Candidate reset files are expected to be under
     `/Users/matthew/git/oss/t-minus-t/guildhall.yaml`,
     `/Users/matthew/git/oss/t-minus-t/.guildhall/`, and
     `/Users/matthew/git/oss/t-minus-t/memory/`.

## Findings So Far

- Workspace import previously inserted imported TODO comments as `ready`
  tasks. That made Thread show "Agent is working" for vague TODO crumbs before
  the spec agent had shaped them. Fixed by importing candidates as
  `exploring`.
- `resume` previously appended a message but did not reliably move a task back
  into spec-agent intake. Fixed so a human reply on a non-terminal task returns
  it to `exploring`.
- Thread single-question replies staged an answer behind a separate footer,
  which felt like "Send did nothing." Fixed so a single active question submits
  immediately; multi-question batches still stage and submit as a group.
- Thread in-flight cards now expose a direct "Tell agent" action so the user
  can correct or redirect the agent without opening the drawer.
- While meta-intake was running, Thread still marked the next setup step as the
  active turn and showed the meta-intake card as "next." Fixed by making
  remaining setup turns pending while the reserved meta-intake task is active.
- Meta-intake asked "Pick all that apply" using a `choice` question, but the
  UI behaved like single-select. Fixed AgentQuestion to switch to multi-select
  when the prompt asks for all/select all/all that apply.
- After answering meta-intake questions, Thread showed the task as shaping but
  the top Start button stayed disabled because bootstrap was incomplete. Fixed
  ProjectView so the reserved meta-intake task can resume the orchestrator even
  while bootstrap is still blocking ordinary work.
- Answering a question while the orchestrator was also writing `TASKS.json`
  corrupted the file with trailing bytes. Fixed the hot runtime/task answer
  write paths to use atomic replace writes, and repaired the test workspace
  `TASKS.json`.
- Agent questions displayed raw Markdown in prompts (`**converter-core**`).
  Fixed AgentQuestion to render prompts/restatements through Markdown.
- Meta-intake kept interviewing coordinator-by-coordinator and repeatedly hit
  the max-turn limit instead of drafting. Tightened the seed prompt: draft
  from repo evidence by default, ask at most two questions, and avoid
  one-question-per-coordinator mandate collection.
- Resetting project-local Guildhall state while role sessions still existed in
  `~/.guildhall/data/sessions` caused meta-intake to resurrect an old draft and
  present it as fresh output. Fixed by refusing meta-intake session recovery
  from snapshots older than the newly seeded meta-intake task.
- The spec agent could still load an old same-workspace role session and
  regenerate the stale draft. Fixed by adding a per-project `memory/.session-epoch`
  namespace to role session ids; deleting `memory/` now creates fresh agent
  sessions.
- The setup identity endpoint kept stale initialized state when files were
  deleted while `guildhall serve` was still running. Fixed by refreshing the
  project before handling setup identity writes.
- In-progress work looked static unless the user already knew the orchestrator
  was running. Added a shared pulsing status light for live agent work without
  animating the whole card.
- Coordinator review copy assumed the user knew what a coordinator was. Fixed
  the Thread and setup review cards to explain that coordinators route future
  tasks to specialists and review work in their area.
- Agent-question cards rendered agent ids and slug choices directly. Fixed the
  UI to display friendly role names and title-cased choice labels, and updated
  meta-intake instructions to ask about project areas/review lanes instead of
  "coordinator domains".
- Multiple-choice question cards were visually weak and treated labels as raw
  strings. Fixed choices to render as full-width selectable rows with
  title/detail treatment, markdown formatting, and a clear selected state.
- "Coordinator" was still Guildhall jargon. Added `guide.coordinators` as a
  docs-backed help topic, wired the circled question-mark help icon into
  coordinator review cards, and lengthened the copy to explain review lanes,
  routing, reviewers, and autonomous handling.
- The task drawer's "Spec fill" checklist answered what the agent was doing,
  but Thread only showed a vague in-flight summary. Thread now projects the
  spec-fill wizard into the in-flight card as live-updating title,
  description, brief, and acceptance-criteria steps.
- Internal ids leaked into user-facing cards (`goal-...`, `task-import-...`,
  `_meta`, `_workspace_import`). Fixed the first visible pass by hiding raw ids
  on Workspace Import and task cards, formatting reserved domains as friendly
  labels, and switching newly generated import ids to compact deterministic
  hashes instead of title-length slugs.
- Native `title` popups are not enough for collapsed navigation. Added a
  reusable `Tooltip` component and wired the collapsed left rail plus docs help
  icons through it.
- Project direction copy sounded like agents start from nothing unless the user
  writes the perfect paragraph. Softened the step copy and prefilled an editable
  draft from README context when no saved direction exists.
- Workspace Import still showed "Approve & import" after approval. Fixed the
  imported state to show "Imported findings" and hide the approval actions.

## Verification Log

- `pnpm vitest run src/runtime/workspace-import/__tests__/hypothesis.test.ts src/runtime/__tests__/workspace-importer.test.ts src/runtime/__tests__/intake.test.ts`
  passed: 3 files, 60 tests.
- `pnpm typecheck` passed.
- `pnpm build` passed with existing Svelte warnings.
- `pnpm docs:extract-help` generated `guide.coordinators` in
  `src/web/generated/help-topics.json`.
- `pnpm vitest run src/runtime/__tests__/serve-meta-intake.test.ts` passed: 9
  tests.
- `pnpm vitest run src/runtime/workspace-import/__tests__/hypothesis.test.ts src/runtime/__tests__/workspace-importer.test.ts src/runtime/__tests__/serve-meta-intake.test.ts`
  passed: 45 tests.
- Browser check at `/planner` showed friendly task card labels ("Workspace
  import", "Setup") with no raw task ids or underscored domains.
- Browser check at `/workspace-import` showed no visible goal/task ids and an
  imported state without the stale "Approve & import" action.
- Restarted linked `t-minus-t` server on `http://localhost:4177`; loaded build
  `2026-04-25T16:01:48.399Z`.
- Browser check at `http://localhost:4177/thread` showed the active intake card
  with the pulsing status light beside the `NOW` badge.
- Browser walk reached fresh setup, provider selection, meta-intake questions,
  multi-select answers, direct Thread guidance, and orchestrator resume.
- Current state after deterministic meta-intake fallback: `task-meta-intake`
  is done, five coordinator roles are merged, and Thread is on the active
  setup step "Give the project direction".

## Resume Notes

- Continue from the browser at `http://localhost:4177/`.
- Current test workspace state:
  - `task-meta-intake` is done.
  - Five coordinator roles are present in `guildhall.yaml`.
  - Project direction was saved from Thread.
  - Workspace Import was approved: 0 tasks, 6 goals, 1 milestone.
  - Planner currently shows only the two reserved completed setup/import tasks.
  - Orchestrator run status is stopped.
- Before resetting `t-minus-t`, ask for explicit confirmation and list the
  exact files/directories to remove.
- After source changes, run `pnpm build` in Guildhall before testing the linked
  package from `t-minus-t`.
- Next likely check: confirm policy levers, then seed a real first task for the
  TypeScript-view workflow and verify the live spec-fill checklist on a
  non-reserved task.
